# TypeScript Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Node.js and TypeScript environment with necessary tools to build and run TypeScript files efficiently.

## Features

Here is the blueprint for the project:

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### 1. Verify Node.js and npm Installation

First, check if you have Node.js and npm installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

If you see version numbers for both, you're good to proceed. If not, you'll need to download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Install TypeScript

To use TypeScript, you need to install it globally on your system. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

After installation, verify that TypeScript is installed correctly by checking its version:

```bash
tsc --version
```

### 3. Install ts-node

`ts-node` allows you to run TypeScript code directly in the Node.js environment, without having to compile it manually each time.

To install `ts-node`, run:

```bash
npm install -g ts-node
```

### 4. Install Nodemon

`nodemon` is a tool that automatically restarts your Node.js server whenever file changes are detected. This is very useful during development.

To install `nodemon`, run:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

### 5. Initialize TypeScript Configuration

Once you have installed the required packages, you can initialize your TypeScript configuration with:

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

Below is the content for your `README.md` file based on the API endpoints you provided:


# API Endpoints Collection

This project includes the following API endpoints:

### POST `/reset-password`
- **Description**: Resets the user's password.

### GET `localhost:3000/`
- **Description**: Fetches the base route of the API.

### GET `localhost:3000/users`
- **Description**: Retrieves a list of all users.

### POST `/signin`
- **Description**: Authenticates a user and provides a session token.

### POST `/logout`
- **Description**: Logs out the authenticated user.

### POST `/signup`
- **Description**: Registers a new user account.

### POST `/verify-email`
- **Description**: Verifies the user's email address.

### POST `/reset-password`
- **Description**: Sends a password reset email to the user.




This will create a `tsconfig.json` file, which allows you to customize TypeScript compilation settings for your project.
